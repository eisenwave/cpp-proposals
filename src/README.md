# C++ proposal sources

This directory contains the source files of my C++ proposals.
You will find two types of files:

- `.cow` files are [COWEL][cowel] documents
- `.bs` files are [bikeshed] documents

Note that these C++ proposals were written while COWEL was still in its infancy,
and so many of these existing documents either will not build at all,
or make heavy use of deprecated features.

The documents are also not standalone but include `libwg21.cow` and `libslides.cow`
for C++ proposals and presentation slides, respectively.
To build documents, you will need to place these files in the same folder
to the `.cow` documents.

[bikeshed]: https://speced.github.io/bikeshed/
